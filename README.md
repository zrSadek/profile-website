## About
This is my personal site that is available at [verlox.cc](https://verlox.cc). I am making this public because of all the requests I receive about it. This is based of certain elements from [obnoxious.club](https://github.com/szolowicz/obnoxious.club) from [szolowicz](https://github.com/szolowicz).

## Click to enter
HTML has a funny thing where you have to 'interact' with a website before you can play audio, so we take care of that by adding the 'click to enter' that is visible. This causes the interaction modern web browsers need to start playing audio.

## Install
Download as ZIP in top right (code dropdown)

## Configuration
`index.html` contains everything.
